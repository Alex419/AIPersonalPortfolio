# 🚀 Alex Gu - Digital Echo Interface Demo

## ✨ What You've Just Created

You now have a **completely unique, dystopian-futuristic portfolio interface** that will absolutely make recruiters remember you. Here's what makes it special:

### 🎭 **The Aesthetic**

- **Scan lines** - CRT monitor aesthetic for that retro-futuristic feel

### 🖥️ **The Interface**
- **Central TV display** - 3D perspective with hover effects
- **Welcome message** - "ALEX GU - DIGITAL ECHO v2.1" with glitch text

### 💬 **The Chat Experience**
