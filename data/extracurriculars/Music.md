# My Musical Journey: A Lifelong Passion for Creation and Performance

Music has always been a central and evolving passion in my life, shaping my creative thinking and reinforcing my group-oriented mindset. My journey spans classical piano, orchestral performance, and contemporary electronic music production and DJing.

## Classical Piano (Early Years)
My musical foundation began with classical piano, where I received extensive training. This involved mastering complex classical pieces, memorizing 20+ pages of music for exams, and progressing through various levels. While the rigorous testing sometimes presented a challenge, my favorite aspect was the collaborative experience of playing in recitals, particularly enjoying duets and four-person pieces where individual parts harmonized into a cohesive whole.

## Orchestral Performance: Trumpet & French Horn
My interest expanded into orchestral settings, starting with the trumpet in concert band. I found immense satisfaction in witnessing the collective effort of many musicians uniting to perform intricate pieces. Inspired by orchestral compositions and movie soundtracks, I transitioned to the French horn approximately a year later, drawn to its unique and beautiful timbre.

### High School Achievements & Recognition:
* **Central District Band (Massachusetts):** Successfully auditioned and was accepted into the prestigious Central District Band of Massachusetts.
* **Performance Venues:** Performed in prominent venues such as Symphony Hall and Mechanics Hall, gaining valuable experience playing alongside highly talented musicians.

## Collegiate Music & Adaptations
Upon entering Tufts University, despite a demanding schedule balancing academics and varsity swimming, I successfully auditioned for and joined the **Tufts Wind Ensemble**. I continued to perform for four semesters, cherishing the experience of contributing to a larger musical collective.

As my Computer Science coursework intensified during my junior and senior years, coupled with my commitment to varsity swimming, maintaining the rigorous practice schedule required for French horn became challenging. This prompted me to explore alternative avenues for musical expression.

## Electronic Music Production & DJing (Current Focus)
I transitioned into **electronic music generation**, discovering the creative freedom offered by MIDI and Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). This allowed me to continue composing and producing music without the time constraints of instrumental practice or formal classes.

* **Current Engagement:** To this day, I maintain a strong interest in creating electronic music and have recently embarked on **DJing**.
* **Creative Outlet:** This new direction has become a vital creative outlet, providing a distinct path for self-expression and innovation within the music landscape.

## Impact & Future Aspirations
Music has significantly contributed to my creative thinking, problem-solving abilities, and my understanding of complex systems, much like in computer science. Alongside my experiences in swimming, it has profoundly shaped my group-oriented mindset and appreciation for collaborative efforts. In the future, I aspire to further develop my DJing skills, with the goal of performing for larger crowds and pursuing music as an independent artistic endeavor.
