### Work & Research Experience

* **Software Engineering Intern at Empower** (May 2024 - August 2024)
    * A software engineering internship where I contributed to front-end development across key platforms (Empower, Personal Capital, and Wells Fargo).
    * I worked in an Agile development workflow using React and Backbone.js, with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    * My main contributions involved enhancing website accessibility standards, which positively impacted over 200,000 impaired users, and implementing a daily blog routing system.
    * This role provided valuable experience in navigating a large enterprise codebase, working with robust industry pipelines, and practicing cross-functional collaboration.

* **Research Intern at MIT Media Lab** (May 2023 - September 2023)
    * A research internship where I developed a conversational AI system aimed at mitigating loneliness in older adults.
    * I was responsible for the end-to-end development of a full-stack application for audio transcription, which included a React frontend and a Python backend.
    * The system leveraged OpenAI's Whisper engine for transcription and used a custom pipeline built with pydub to solve the problem of speaker diarization.
    * This project highlights proficiency in conversational AI design, API integration, and user-centric problem-solving, particularly in overcoming technical challenges with real-world data.

* **Research Intern at Tufts University BCI Lab** (June 2022 - September 2022)
    * A research internship where I contributed to two distinct projects: an EEG study using a Muse device to predict chess move quality with Python-based machine learning code, and a project to create eye-tracking heat maps for environmental policy research.
    * The latter required a major effort in data organization and normalization to handle inconsistent formats.
    * This experience showcases practical skills in data acquisition, processing, and visualization, alongside research methodology and critical problem-solving with messy, real-world data.

* **Physical Education Teacher (PE 0110 Independent Study)** - Spring 2025
    * As a coach for a beginners' swim class at Tufts, I applied my passion for teaching within a structured academic environment.
    * I developed and adapted a progressive curriculum to increase endurance and teach all four swim strokes.
    * This role helped to refine my teaching methodology and enhancing my interpersonal skills, as I focused on giving constructive feedback in a way that was clear and not overwhelming, a mindset I carry into all my projects and collaborations.

* **Swim Lesson Instructor & Coach** (2017 - Present)
    * A continuous and foundational role for over 8 years, serving as a swim instructor and coach for individuals ranging from infants to adults.
    * This experience has been instrumental in cultivating a robust set of leadership, communication, and emotional intelligence skills.
    * It has provided me with practical experience in leading groups, providing constructive feedback, and adapting my teaching methodology to diverse learning styles and emotional needs.
    * The role has also reinforced my belief in the power of education and mentorship, aligning with my broader aspirations to use technology to enhance human capabilities and well-being.
