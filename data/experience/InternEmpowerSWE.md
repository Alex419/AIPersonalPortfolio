# Software Engineering Intern at Empower (May 2024 - August 2024)
Empower is a leading financial services company providing retirement solutions and financial planning tools. During my internship in Boston, MA, I contributed to front-end development across key initiatives, focusing on enhancing user experience and content delivery for millions of users.

## Role & Responsibilities
As a Software Engineering Intern, my primary roles included:
* Upholding and implementing accessibility standards across the Empower, Personal Capital, and Wells Fargo platforms.
* Contributing to the migration and integration of a daily blog system as part of the Feature Parity project.
* Engaging with industry-standard development processes, including code merging, environment setup, and comprehensive testing protocols.
* Developing and maintaining applications using **Backbone.js** and **React**, with a strong foundation in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
* Collaborating with QA teams, product managers, and fellow engineers within an **Agile development workflow**.

## Key Projects & Contributions

### 1. Enhancing Website Accessibility Standards
This project focused on ensuring the Empower platform was inclusive and accessible to all users, positively impacting over **200,000 impaired users**.
* **Challenge:** Prior to this internship, I had limited exposure to web accessibility standards. The core challenge was not just implementing code changes, but understanding the profound impact of these standards and navigating a complex enterprise-level codebase. This involved learning intricate deployment pipelines, coordinating with QA to prevent regressions, and adapting to concurrent changes from other teams.
* **Solution & My Contribution:** I meticulously updated various pages and components to adhere to accessibility guidelines. Specific changes included:
    * Ensuring **high color contrasts** for color-blind users.
    * Creating **descriptive labeling for page elements** to enhance screen reader compatibility for low-vision users.
    * Refactoring component structures and styles to ensure proper semantic parsing.
* **Impact:** My work directly enhanced the usability and inclusivity of the platform for a significant user base. It instilled a deep sense of pride, fostering a desire to leverage technology, particularly AI, to enhance human capabilities in future roles.
* **Learnings & Challenges:**
    * **Enterprise Development Lifecycle:** Gained first-hand experience with robust industry pipelines, including sandbox environments, QA processes, and staggered deployments, highlighting the importance of meticulous change management.
    * **Codebase Navigation:** Developed advanced skills in navigating and understanding large, unfamiliar codebases and diverse coding styles, improving efficiency in pinpointing relevant code sections.
    * **Frontend Details:** Realized the critical impact of seemingly minor frontend details (colors, links, component labels, screen reader parsing) on overall user experience and accessibility.
    * **Scale:** First time working on a project of this magnitude and complexity within a large organizational structure.

### 2. Implementing Daily Blog Routing System (Feature Parity Project)
This project was part of a broader initiative to integrate beneficial features from an acquired banking company into Empower's platform, specifically focusing on a Daily Blog system designed to provide financial news and advice, improving user engagement.
* **Challenge:** The core difficulty was adapting the existing blog system (built in a different frontend framework) to Empower's distinct tech stack. This was not a simple routing or styling task; it required significant code transfer, adaptation, and refactoring to fit Empower's **Backbone.js and React** environment.
* **Solution & My Contribution:** I focused on modifying and adapting the transferred files and logic to correctly route and display blog content within Empower's framework. This involved:
    * Migrating relevant content and routing configurations.
    * Transforming components and logic to align with Empower's existing UI and data structures.
* **Impact:** Successfully integrated a valuable content management system, contributing to Empower's strategy of consolidating features from acquired assets and aiming to improve content management and user engagement.
* **Learnings:** This project was primarily a technical adaptation challenge, honing my ability to analyze, transform, and integrate code from disparate systems into a cohesive application. It deepened my understanding of how different frontend frameworks handle routing and component logic.

## Technologies Used
* **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
* **Frameworks/Libraries:** React, Backbone.js
* **Version Control:** GitHub (for code merging)
* **CI/CD & Testing:** Jenkins (for deployment pipeline interaction), Jest, React Testing Library
* **Methodology:** Agile Scrum

## Skills Developed
* **Technical Skills:** Frontend Development, Web Accessibility (WCAG standards awareness), API Integration, Code Refactoring, Cross-Framework Adaptation, Unit/Integration Testing, Git Version Control, Debugging.
* **Soft Skills:** Cross-functional Collaboration (with PM, UX, QA), Problem-Solving (especially system-level), Adaptability (to new codebases and processes), Attention to Detail, Understanding User Empathy (accessibility).
