### Physical Education Teaching Assistant: Beginners Swim (PE 0110 Independent Study) - Spring 2025

Building on my extensive background as a swim instructor, I had the opportunity to serve as the teacher for a beginners' swim class at Tufts University. This independent study course (PE 0110) was open to other college students, allowing me to apply my passion for teaching within a structured academic environment. This experience was helped to refine my teaching methodology and enhancing my interpersonal skills, and I loved teaching fellow students.

#### Role and Curriculum
I taught the beginner level of the course, which was designed for students who already had some basic swimming proficiency, such as being able to float and swim short distances. This prerequisite ensured the class could focus on more advanced fundamentals rather than basic water acclimation.

The core curriculum was designed to:

* **Increase Endurance:** I created and adapted swimming sets to improve students' stamina and physical conditioning throughout the semester.
* **Refine Technique:** I instructed students on proper body positioning, breathing, and other core swimming techniques.
* **Teach All Four Strokes:** I provided comprehensive instruction on butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle, including flip turns and dives.

#### Teaching Philosophy & Impact
My approach to teaching is centered on a strong desire to connect with and understand my students. I believe in giving constant, constructive feedback, but I'm careful to deliver it in a way that isn't overwhelming. I learned that focusing on just a few key points at a time is far more effective for my students' learning and progress. This philosophy of prioritizing impactful, concise feedback is a mindset I carry into all my projects and collaborations.

I also maintained an open and receptive stance to feedback on my own teaching methods. By actively soliciting feedback from my students, I was able to continuously improve my instruction and ensure our time was used as productively as possible. This approach demonstrates a commitment to collaboration, efficiency, and continuous improvement in any teaching or team-based role.

### Skills Developed
* **Teaching & Pedagogy:** I developed and adapted a comprehensive curriculum for a collegiate audience, tailoring instruction to individual progression and skill level.
* **Interpersonal Communication:** I learned to connect with and effectively teach peers, refining a teaching style that is natural, empathetic, and clear.
* **Constructive Feedback:** I mastered the art of giving feedback that is both direct and manageable, focusing on a few key points for maximum impact.
* **Emotional Intelligence:** I showcased a high degree of empathy and self-awareness by adapting my teaching style based on student feedback and needs.
* **Organizational & Planning:** I created and managed structured practice sets and a progressive curriculum for a full semester.
