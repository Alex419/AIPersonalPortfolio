# Research Intern at Tufts University Brain Computer Interface (BCI) Lab (June 2022 - September 2022)

During my summer internship at the Tufts University BCI Lab in Medford, MA, I contributed to two distinct research projects, gaining hands-on experience with data processing, scientific methodology, and early machine learning applications in a research environment.

## Key Projects & Contributions

### 1. EEG Study: Chess Game Performance & Brain Signals
This project aimed to explore the correlation between participants' EEG (brain) signals and the quality of their moves in a chess game, contributing to a broader series of studies guiding future BCI research.
* **Objective:** To understand how EEG signals relate to cognitive decision-making during a complex task like chess, specifically to predict future good or bad moves.
* **My Contribution:**
    * **Data Acquisition:** Assisted in running study participants and collecting incoming brain data directly from a **Muse device**.
    * **Machine Learning Application:** Developed and applied **Python-based machine learning code** to analyze the EEG signals and predict the quality of participants' future chess moves.
    * **Research & Analysis:** Conducted significant literature review and scientific paper readings to understand brain data interpretation and experimental methodologies.
* **Skills Applied:** Data Collection, Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) fundamentals, Machine Learning (predictive modeling), Research Methodology, Scientific Literature Review, Python Programming.

### 2. Eye-Tracking Heat Map Overlay for Environmental Policy & Planning (DEPP)
This collaboration with the Tufts Department of Environmental Policy and Planning (DEPP) focused on identifying areas of interest along campus walking paths through eye-tracking data, with the goal of making these spaces more enjoyable and walkable.
* **Objective:** To visually represent participant eye fixation patterns on images of campus walkways to determine what elements captured their attention most.
* **My Contribution & Problem-Solving:**
    * **Data Ingestion & Organization:** Faced significant challenges with the raw eye-tracking data being highly inconsistent in format and unorganized, stemming from multiple collection devices with varying dimensions and pixel counts. I undertook a major effort in **data organization and normalization** to ensure comparability across datasets.
    * **Data Processing & Heat Map Generation:**
        * Treated screen coordinates as a graph, plotting and scaling points based on the dimensions and pixel count of the source devices.
        * Utilized **Python libraries** to generate heat maps, coloring regions based on the frequency and concentration of eye fixation points within defined windows. This visually highlighted areas participants looked at longest.
    * **Image Overlay:** Successfully developed the process to overlay these transparent heat maps onto the original images of campus walkways, providing intuitive visual insights to the DEPP team.
* **Impact:** Provided actionable visual data to the DEPP team, aiding their efforts to identify and enhance elements that contribute to a more engaging and pleasant walking environment on campus.
* **Learnings & Challenges:** This project was a deep dive into practical data cleaning, organization, and normalization in a real-world messy dataset. It highlighted the importance of robust data preprocessing before analysis and visualization. I gained significant experience in visual data representation and adapting techniques to inconsistent data inputs.
