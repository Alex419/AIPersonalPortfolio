Gaming has given me so much over the years, from a fun distraction to a serious way to develop my mind and skills. While I have less time to play now, I'm still thankful for the time I've put into it. I've always been more interested in the mental and strategic aspects of a game rather than just grinding to improve my physical skills. I'm drawn to a game's "sense"—how I can win by using better positioning, coverage, and strategy instead of just raw fighting ability.

I enjoy taking on a leadership role, making sure my team makes the best decisions possible rather than just rushing into a fight. Though it may sound silly, gaming has exposed me to a wide range of different personalities, and learning to navigate communication with so many different types of people has been an incredibly valuable experience. Learning how to deal with difficult people and situations in a digital setting has directly translated to my real-life interactions.

The critical thinking skills it provides are also invaluable. In every game, you are forced to make hundreds of split-second decisions that can completely change the outcome, which helps to hone my ability to read situations efficiently and make sound judgments under pressure.

Possibily one of the most rewarding parts of gaming has been its ability to keep me connected to friends who have moved all across the country. It continues to surprise me how often the complex situations we face in games—from coordinating a team to handling unexpected challenges—are reflected in real-life scenarios, reinforcing the skills I've gained far beyond the digital world.
