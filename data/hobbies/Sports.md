My  Passion for Sports
Sports have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I started with soccer and figure skating, but it was in 2011 that I found swimming. I dedicated myself to the sport for over a decade, culminating in my time as a varsity athlete at Tufts University, where I recently concluded my competitive career in Spring 2025.

While I've always loved the discipline of solo training, I've found that my favorite way to stay active is with friends. Whether it's a game of pickup basketball, an intense round of Spikeball, or a friendly soccer match, these activities are the perfect blend of competition and quality time. They keep me active, feed my competitive spirit, and allow me to connect with the people I care about most.

Since leaving the pool, I've been spending more and more time on the basketball court, slowly perfecting my shooting and ball-handling skills. It's a great way to give my mind a break from work and stay in shape. Even when we're apart, my friends and I love to talk about how we've improved. I'm always looking forward to the next time we can play togetherâ€”because, I have to keep practicing so I can destroy them on the court.
