My Journey into DJing: Sharing Music and Creating Experiences

Learning to DJ is a relatively new hobby I've taken up, born from a lifelong love of music. With less time to dedicate to practicing a physical instrument like the French horn, I was drawn to DJing as a new creative outletâ€”something my friends were also exploring.

For me, the most powerful thing about music is its ability to impact your mood and elevate a moment. For years, some of the most fun I've ever had has been at EDM concerts with friends, dancing and singing along to our favorite artists. I wanted to be able to bring that same feeling of shared joy and energy into my daily life without needing to travel to a show. DJing became the perfect way to do that.

Throwing together sets filled with my favorite music has been awesome, and it's a feeling I've been able to share with others. My friends and I started DJing for small get-togethers and eventually had the opportunity to play at parties hosted by the swim team and around campus. It's a way for me to continue my passion for music and to bring that same joy and sense of shared experience to my friends and community.

Ultimately, I hope to get good enough to play concerts and bring that joy to many more people!
