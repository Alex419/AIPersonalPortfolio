Project Overview
This is a summary of my key technical projects and initiatives, showcasing my skills in software engineering, AI/ML, and web development.

AI-Powered Personal Portfolio (Summer 2025)

A dynamic, web-based application designed to transform my personal portfolio into an interactive experience. Leveraging AI and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the platform acts as a conversational "digital me" to answer natural language questions about my projects, skills, and experiences. The core of the project is a RAG pipeline built with LangChain for loading and chunking my structured Markdown documents and using Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash for text generation. The data is processed by a corresponding Google embedding model and stored in a ChromaDB vector store for efficient semantic search. Key to the project's effectiveness are carefully engineered system prompts and a hierarchical data structure with dedicated overview files to optimize for both summary-level and granular queries.


NASA ExoSky (Fall 2024)

An interactive web application developed during a NASA Hackathon to make learning about space and exoplanets engaging for younger students. The platform's core functionality allows users to explore planets, dynamically changing their viewpoint of the galaxy based on what planet they are on and the NASA Exoplanet Archive data. A key innovative feature uses YOLO image recognition to identify user-drawn constellations, which are then used to prompt Groq to generate a fantastical story. The project highlights a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a Flask backend deployed on Azure Web Apps, demonstrating proficiency in rapid prototyping, multimodal AI integration, and the use of real-world scientific data.


TuffMarketplace (Fall 2022 - Fall 2024)

A community-centric online marketplace and entrepreneurial venture designed to address the inefficiencies of general marketplaces for Tufts students. The project successfully used an Instagram-first approach for market validation, amassing 1,800 followers (approximately one-third of the undergraduate population) and was an opportunity to gain a strong understanding of consumer psychology and community building. The core learning of the project was for business growth and understand consumer thought processes. In the future, could develop AI agents to fully automate the posting and verification process, allowing the platform to be efficiently scaled and replicated across other university campuses.


Cudney Family Apiaries Website (Summer 2025)

An informational website developed to help a small-batch honey producer expand their business and establish a digital presence. This project served as a hands-on experience in both web development technologies and business scaling strategies, from initial concept to deployment. The site was built using React, Tailwind CSS v4, and Vite, with an architectural plan for future e-commerce integration via a Node.js/Flask backend. This project is still in progress and is providing me with insight into the process of scaling a business to a nationwide level, including understanding sales funnels and consumer mindset.

High-Altitude Gamma Ray Spectrometer: A senior capstone project where I contributed to a multidisciplinary team to design and build a low-cost, DIY scientific weather balloon payload. The project highlights my skills in hardware-software integration, PID control logic, data acquisition, and robust system design.

Somerville Homeless Coalition App: A full-stack web application developed for Tufts JumboCode that streamlines the application process for financial relief. The project demonstrates my skills in React, Node.js, and MongoDB to create a real-world tool with social impact.

DJ Transition Analysis & Visualization: A platform that uses a custom Python data processing pipeline to deconstruct and visualize the techniques used in DJ transitions. This project showcases deep problem-solving skills in data aggregation, event-stream analysis, and scalability.
