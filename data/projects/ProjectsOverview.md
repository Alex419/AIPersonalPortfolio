### Project Overview

This is a summary of my key technical projects and initiatives, showcasing my skills in software engineering, AI/ML, and web development.

* **AI-Powered Personal Portfolio** (Summer 2025 - Present)
    * A dynamic, web-based application that acts as a conversational "digital me" using AI and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions about my projects, skills, and experiences.
    * The core of the project is a RAG pipeline built with LangChain for loading and chunking Markdown documents, using Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash for text generation.
    * Data is processed by a corresponding Google embedding model and stored in a ChromaDB vector store for efficient semantic search.
    * The project's effectiveness is due to carefully engineered system prompts and a hierarchical data structure to optimize for both summary-level and granular queries.

* **DJ Transition Analysis & Visualization Platform** (Summer 2025 - Present)
    * A web-based platform designed to teach about DJ mixing by deconstructing and visualizing a DJ's performance.
    * The backend is a sophisticated Python data processing pipeline built with custom algorithms to transform raw MIDI signal data from DJ controllers into a clean, human-readable narrative.
    * A React/Tailwind CSS frontend provides a foundation for the future visualization layer, highlighting deep problem-solving skills in backend data processing, software architecture, and solving a complex problem with a combination of different approaches.
    * Using Firebase to store transition and song data based on user provided input.

* **Cudney Family Apiaries Website** (Summer 2025 - Ongoing)
    * An informational website developed to help a small-batch honey producer expand their business and establish a digital presence.
    * The site was built using React, Tailwind CSS v4, and Vite, with a clear architectural plan for future e-commerce integration via a Node.js/Flask backend.
    * This project highlights proficiency in front-end development and iterative design, and provides unique insight into business scaling strategies.

* **DIY Gamma Ray Spectrometer** (Fall 2024 - Spring 2025)
    * A multidisciplinary senior capstone project to design, build, and test a low-cost Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) payload.
    * The system's hardware circuit consisted of a BGO crystal, SiPMs, a summing circuit, and an amplifier/shaper before being processed by a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller.
    * The project also featured a custom PID control logic to regulate temperature and altitude, showcasing practical skills in hardware-software integration, circuit design, and robust system engineering.

* **NASA ExoSky** (October 2024, Hackathon)
    * A web application developed during a NASA Hackathon to make learning about space and exoplanets interactive for younger students.
    * A key feature uses YOLO image recognition to identify user-drawn constellations, which are then used to prompt Groq to generate a fantastical story.
    * The project highlights a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a Flask backend deployed on Azure Web Apps, demonstrating proficiency in rapid prototyping and multimodal AI integration.

* **TuffMarketplace** (Fall 2022 - Spring 2024)
    * A community-centric online marketplace and entrepreneurial venture designed to address the inefficiencies of general marketplaces for Tufts students.
    * This project successfully used an Instagram-first approach for market validation, amassing 1,800 followers and demonstrating a strong understanding of consumer psychology.
    * The core learning was leveraging technology for business growth, with a future vision for AI agents to fully automate the posting and verification process.

* **Somerville Homeless Coalition Application Processing Tool** (Fall 2023 - Spring 2024)
    * A full-stack web application built for the Somerville Homeless Coalition to address a post-COVID bottleneck in processing financial aid applications.
    * The application was developed using React.js for the frontend, a Node.js/Express.js backend, and a MongoDB database, with deployment handled by Vercel.
    * Its core functionality is an automated matching tool that uses a set-based algorithm to instantly pair clients with eligible funding sources, showcasing skills in full-stack web development and client-facing project management.

* **Private Automated Contact Tracing Research at MIT** (May 2020 - July 2020)
    * A research project to investigate the viability of using Bluetooth signal strength for automated COVID-19 contact tracing.
    * I designed and executed a series of experiments using Python and two Raspberry Pis to measure signal strength and the effect of various obstructions.
    * The key finding was that using Bluetooth for precise distance calculation was unreliable, as the signal wavered significantly, demonstrating strong skills in scientific research methodology and critical analysis.
