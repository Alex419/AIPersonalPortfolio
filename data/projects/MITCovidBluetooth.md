### Project: Private Automated Contact Tracing Research at MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute (May 2020 - July 2020)

**Project Overview**
During the MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute in Cambridge, MA, I contributed to a critical research project focused on developing private automated contact tracing methods for the COVID-19 pandemic. The core objective was to investigate the viability and reliability of using Bluetooth signal strength from cellular devices to accurately determine proximity for contact tracing, aiming to provide a technological solution for social distancing monitoring and exposure notification.

**Problem Statement**
In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an urgent need for effective, private methods to track potential viral exposure and encourage social distancing. I wanted to determine if readily available technology, specifically Bluetooth signals from personal devices, could reliably measure proximity between individuals to inform users if they had been in close contact with an infected person, thereby mitigating spread.

**Solution & My Contribution**
My primary contribution involved rigorously testing the reliability of Bluetooth signal strength for proximity detection. This research aimed to assess whether a system could accurately calculate distance between individuals despite environmental variables.

**Experimental Design & Execution:**
* Utilized Python to develop a custom application for sending and receiving Bluetooth signals.
* Deployed this application on two Raspberry Pis to simulate real-world interactions.
* Conducted experiments to measure the strength of Bluetooth signals and determine distance, while systematically testing the effect of various human body positions and different physical objects (obstructions) on signal integrity.

**Data Analysis & Visualization:**
* Cleaned, organized, and processed the collected experimental data.
* Used Excel to produce clear charts for analysis, highlighting the relationship between signal strength, distance, and environmental factors.

**Key Finding:** My research conclusively demonstrated that using strictly Bluetooth signals from personal devices (like phones) for precise distance calculation was unreliable. The signal strength wavered significantly due to obstructions, making it extremely difficult to accurately determine risk of exposure.

### **Technologies Used**
* **Languages:** Python
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (x2), Cellular Device
* **Software/Tools:** Excel (for data analysis), Bluetooth (for signal measurement)

* **Scientific Research Methodology:** Gained practical experience in designing experiments, collecting data systematically, and drawing conclusions from empirical evidence.
* **Data Collection & Processing:** Developed skills in cleaning, organizing, and processing raw experimental data for analysis.
* **Hardware-Software Interfacing:** Applied Python programming to control and integrate hardware components (Raspberry Pis, Bluetooth modules).
* **Problem-Solving & Critical Analysis:** Identified and thoroughly investigated a critical technical limitation (Bluetooth signal unreliability), leading to a clear, evidence-based conclusion. This demonstrated an ability to challenge assumptions and provide practical insights.
* **Data Visualization:** Utilized Excel to effectively visualize experimental results and communicate findings.
