Hello, I am Alex Gu!

I am currently a student attending Columbia University for a Master's in
Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning and AI. 

This is my digital portfolio so that you can learn about me in a more
interactive way. You are infact talking to AI, so if you get a weird answer
in any way, just blame the model. The way it responds may not be perfect, and
the information definitely does not span everything, so please reach out to me
with any serious inquiries or concerns.

Have fun asking about me!
